# fmm
An implementation of the Fast-Multipole Method (currently works up to 3 levels in a reasonable amount of time)

Authors: Andy Jiang, Georgia Institute of Technology and Andrew C. Simmonett, National Institutes of Health

Features:
- Uses Real Spherical Harmonic Multipoles, using the normalization convention given in Anthony J. Stone's The Theory of Intermolecular Forces, Second Edition
- Uses Real Rotation Matrices to rotate the spherical harmonics to allow for more efficient code translation
- Useful for a beginner wanting to learn more about the FMM algorithm
